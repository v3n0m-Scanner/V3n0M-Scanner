[Live Project - Python3.6]

V3n0M is a free and open source scanner. Evolved from baltazar's scanner, it has adapted several new features that improve fuctionality and usability. It is __mostly__ experimental software.

This program is for finding and executing various vulnerabilities. It scavenges the web using dorks and organizes the URLs it finds.
**Use at your own risk.**

## Very useful for executing:


+ Cloudflare Resolver[Cloudbuster]
+ LFI->RCE and XSS Scanning[LFI->RCE & XSS]
+ SQL Injection Vuln Scanner[SQLi]
+ Extremely Large D0rk Target Lists
+ AdminPage Finding
+ Toxin [Vulnerable FTPs Scanner] [To Be Released Soon]
+ DNS BruteForcer
+ Python 3.6 Asyncio based scanning

## What You Hold:

**The official adoption of darkd0rker heavily recoded, updated, expanded and improved upon**
+ Brand new, just outta the box!
+ Most efficient cloudflare resolver around with easy to use interface.
+ Extremely quick "Toxin" Vulnerable IP scanner to scan potentially millions of ips for known vulnerable services.
+ Largest and most powerful d0rker online, 14k+d0rks searched over ~ Engines at once.
+ Free and Open /src/
+ CrossPlatform Python based toolkit
